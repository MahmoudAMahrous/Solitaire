# Solitaire
Solitaire prototype

Notes:
- This Project uses DoTween and TextMeshPro.
- I didn't have enough time to test on a mobile phone but I still implemented a (Lock Rotation) code.
- For the lack of time the camera position is sat as fixed values (hopefully it fits most devices), The intention was to make the camera adjust to fit all objects in view.
- PlayerPrefs is used to store the current game if the player closes the game, It's not recommended to use it but for the lack of time it was a quick option.
